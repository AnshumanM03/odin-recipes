    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>A brownie is a popular baked dessert characterized by its dense, 
            fudgy texture and rich chocolate flavor.  
            They may also include additions like nuts, chocolate chips, or frosting. 
            Originating in the United States, brownies can range from chewy to cake-like, depending on the recipe, and are often enjoyed as a sweet treat or dessert.
