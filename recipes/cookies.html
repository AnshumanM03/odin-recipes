        <p>
            A chocolate chip cookie is a popular type of cookie featuring a dough base mixed with chocolate chips. 
            These cookies are typically sweet and buttery, with a crisp edge and a chewy center. 
            The chocolate chips, made from semi-sweet or milk chocolate, melt slightly during baking, creating pockets of rich chocolate throughout the cookie. 
            Perfect as a snack or dessert, chocolate chip cookies are a timeless favorite enjoyed by people of all ages.
